- **Promotional_Response**: Response to promotional campaigns (Yes/No).
- **Feedback_Score**: Customer satisfaction score (1â€“5).

## Objectives

The analysis addresses the following business questions:

1. What are the primary customer demographics (e.g., age, gender)?
2. Which services are most popular among customers?
3. What is the impact of loyalty programs on customer spending and visit frequency?
4. How responsive are customers to promotional campaigns?
5. What factors influence customer satisfaction scores?

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Summary statistics and visualizations of customer demographics and behaviors.
  - Distribution analysis of age, spending, and visit frequency.
